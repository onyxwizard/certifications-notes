# 📋 GitHub Projects: Organize, Prioritize & Collaborate

GitHub Projects (now known as **GitHub Issues Dashboard** or **Projects (Beta)**) helps teams plan, track, and manage their work visually. This module walks you through setting up custom fields, managing priorities, adding items in bulk, and collaborating with your team.



## 🧱 Getting Started with GitHub Projects

### What is GitHub Projects?
GitHub Projects allows you to:
- Visualize issues and pull requests across repositories
- Create custom workflows with columns like To Do, In Progress, Done
- Add custom fields like Priority, Status, Iteration, and more
- Share and collaborate with teammates

> 💡 Think of it as a **Kanban board meets project management tool**, directly integrated with your codebase.
