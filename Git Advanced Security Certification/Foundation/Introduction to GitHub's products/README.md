## 💸 Understanding GitHub Billing

GitHub bills **per account type**:
- Your personal account gets its own bill
- So do each of your organization and enterprise accounts

### Two Types of Charges:

2. **Usage-Based** – Costs based on usage (like extra GitHub Actions minutes)

💡 Tip: Set spending limits to avoid surprises!



## 📊 License Usage & Metered Billing

Large teams and enterprises must track **license usage** to stay within budget and comply with policies.

### Who Uses Licenses?
- Active users with access to private repos
- Machine accounts (used by automation tools)
- Peripheral services (like CI/CD runners)

### Tools to Track Usage:
- **GitHub Admin Console**
- **GraphQL API**
- **REST API**

📊 Use these tools to audit and reclaim unused licenses.
